- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability lies in the insecure.js server's method of updating a user's role, which 
relies solely on the provided user ID to determine admin privileges. Malicious users who gain 
access to an admin's user ID can exploit this weakness by impersonating the admin and altering 
their role to a potentially lower privileged one. 
In the secure version, the server mitigates this vulnerability by implementing session-based 
user validation. Before executing any role changes, the server cross-references the user ID stored 
in the session with the one provided. Only if these match is the role update allowed to proceed, 
ensuring that the user requesting the change is indeed the logged-in admin.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
mplement stringent input validation mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of user-provided data, 
particularly the user ID used for role updates. By validating inputs rigorously, the system can 
thwart injection attacks and ensure that only authorized user IDs are accepted for role modifications.
