- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability lies within the text input field that accepts user names. In the 'insecure.js' 
server implementation, the input is not properly validated, leaving it susceptible to malicious 
script injection. Exploiting this flaw, a malicious user can input script code into the field, 
which will subsequently execute on the server. This can result in severe data breaches and various 
other vulnerabilities.

In contrast, the 'secure.js' server employs a sanitization function to preprocess the input text 
before utilization. This function effectively replaces all special characters with their plain text 
equivalents, thereby thwarting any attempts at injecting script code into the server.

- Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering is a critical breach that primarily undermines the integrity aspect of information security, 
essential for maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. When tampering occurs,
unauthorized modifications can disrupt operations, introduce misleading information, or result in financial 
losses. This jeopardizes the reliability of systems and data, eroding trust in their accuracy and dependability. 
Thus, tampering poses a substantial threat to information integrity, highlighting the importance of implementing 
robust security measures to thwart unauthorized alterations and uphold the reliability of both data and systems.
