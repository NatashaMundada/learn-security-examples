- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The insecure.js server lacks a mechanism to track server activities, making it impossible to validate 
the origin of user-generated content such as messages. Without proper logs, it's challenging to 
ascertain whether a message was indeed posted by the claimed user or by someone else, leading to 
potential disputes and repudiation issues.
In the secure.js server, this vulnerability is addressed by implementing a logging mechanism that 
meticulously records all server activities. These logs create an audit trail, enabling administrators 
to track and verify both server and user actions accurately. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Implement robust user authentication mechanisms to restrict server access to authorized users only. 
Techniques like multi-factor authentication and effective session management enhance security by 
preventing unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding the integrity of user-generated content and server activities.
