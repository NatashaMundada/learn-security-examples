- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure.js server exposes an API allowing fetching user data based on the '_id' query parameter. 
However, the MongoDB query used to match the '_id' for a document only requires an ObjectId string as 
input. This lax input validation leaves the server vulnerable to attacks, as malicious users can pass 
arbitrary strings or values through the API. This can cause the MongoDB query function to throw an 
unhandled exception, leading to server crashes. Malicious users could exploit this vulnerability to 
repeatedly crash all server instances.
In contrast, the secure.js server addresses this vulnerability by implementing a try-catch block to 
handle exceptions gracefully. Instead of crashing the server, invalid inputs are caught, 
preventing the server from going down. This ensures the server remains operational even when 
encountering unexpected or malicious input.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
ncorporate rate limiting to restrict the number of requests that can be made to the API within a 
specific time frame. By imposing limits on request rates, the impact of a malicious user attempting 
to crash the server by sending invalid inputs can be mitigated, preserving server stability and 
performance under attack scenarios.
